When most people hear “Machine Learning,” they picture a robot: a dependable butler
or a deadly Terminator depending on who you ask. But Machine Learning is not
just a futuristic fantasy, it’s already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in
some specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the
first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds
of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: it was the spam filter.
Not exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning
(it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore).
It was followed by hundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds
of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations
to voice search.
Where does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it
mean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my
computer really “learned” something? Is it suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will
start by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may want to use it.
Then, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a
look at the map and learn about the main regions and the most notable landmarks:
supervised versus unsupervised learning, online versus batch learning, instancebased
versus model-based learning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML
project, discuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and
fine-tune a Machine Learning system.
